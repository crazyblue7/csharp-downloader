# hello
this is just a downloader that downloads files from the internet.
made because chrome doesnt download anything for me (for some reason)
# how to use
just paste a link to a file in the textbox and click the download button.
the file will be saved to C:\Users\yourUser\file.txt. replace yourUser
with your users folder name, or basically just %USERPROFILE%\file.txt if you
understand that.
# note
# i MIGHT change the default downloads directory in the future, might also make it possible to change some download settings, like changing the downloads directory, or making it so that you can choose where a file is saved
