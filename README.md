# hello
this is just a downloader that downloads files from the internet
made because at the time of making this, chromiums built in downloader
just doesnt work for me (it doesnt download anything) :/
# how to use
just paste a link to a file in the textbox and click the download button.
the file will be saved to C:\Users\yourUser\file.extension. replace yourUser
with your users folder name, or basically just %USERPROFILE%\file.extension if you
know that
# note
# i MIGHT change the default downloads directory in the future, might also make it possible to change some download settings, like changing the downloads directory, or making it so that you can choose where a file is saved
